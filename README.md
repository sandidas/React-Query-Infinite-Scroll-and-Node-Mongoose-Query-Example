# React Query Infinite Scroll and Node Mongoose Query Example

This repository provides an example implementation of infinite scroll functionality using React Query on the frontend and Node.js with Mongoose on the backend. The code demonstrates how to efficiently load and display large sets of data using pagination and lazy loading techniques.

# Features
+ Infinite scroll implementation in React using React Query
+ Server-side pagination using Node.js and Mongoose
+ Efficient data fetching and caching with React Query's query and mutation hooks
+ MongoDB database integration with Mongoose for storing and querying data
+ React components showcasing the implementation of infinite scroll


# Installation
+ I have shared 2 different versions of folder structure, one for nextjs 13 and one for node.js and mongoose.
+ You can find which packages i have installed on these projects.

# Usage
The example provides a simple frontend that fetches and displays data using infinite scroll. The backend sets up a MongoDB connection using Mongoose and exposes an API endpoint for fetching paginated data.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it according to your requirements. You can use this example as a reference for implementing infinite scroll in your own projects using React Query and Node.js with Mongoose.
